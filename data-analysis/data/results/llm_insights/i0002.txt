crunchgainesville SQUAtober starts now! 🎉 $1 to join + ALL October FREE with Code SQUAT. Join online now at 👉 ... more

REASONING: I transcribed all visible, legible text from the advertisement image: the Crunch Fitness logo and the header 'MEMBERSHIP OPTIONS'; the four membership column headers and their visible monthly prices ($29.99, $24.99, $15.99, $9.99); the table row labels (amenities and items like 'Annual Commitment?', 'State-of-the-Art Equipment', 'Saunas', 'Cancel Anytime', 'Awesome Group Fitness Classes', 'Access to over 500+ Crunch Gyms', 'Unlimited Hydromassage®', etc.); the bottom pricing/total boxes (noting crossed-out enrollment and dues and the visible totals of $1.00 +tax and $44.32 +tax); and the small-print lines about the annual fee and $2 processing fee. I also captured the visible Instagram caption text at the bottom promoting 'SQUAtober' and the $1 join offer with promo code SQUAT. Some very small or blurred characters (for example tiny crossed-out dollar amounts) were transcribed as descriptive notes where the exact numerals were unreadable.

2. TARGET DEMOGRAPHICS
Age Range: 18-35

REASONING: Visual style and messaging point to a younger adult audience: bright, saturated colors (orange, magenta, teal, blue) and a compact infographic layout are typical of brands targeting millennials and Gen Z. The $9.99–$29.99 price points, month-to-month options, emphasis on group classes, HIIT and ride studios, and social-media promo language ("SQUAtober", emoji, short URL/"Join online now") strongly suggest the ad is aimed at budget-conscious young adults who value class-based group fitness and flexible, low-cost memberships (commonly 18–35).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3. VISUAL CLASSIFICATION
Type: Digital Art

REASONING: The ad is a designed infographic/table: crisp vector text, colored block columns, checkmark icons, a logo, and small-print legal lines rather than a photographic scene. The layout and flat colors indicate a digitally produced marketing image rather than a photographed or 3D-rendered scene.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

4. BUTTON ANALYSIS
Button Color: N/A
Button Text: N/A

REASONING: There is no prominent, enclosed call-to-action button inside the ad artwork itself. The promotion uses text-based CTAs in the Instagram caption (e.g., 'Join online now at 👉') rather than a visible button with a distinctive color/label within the image. Because no button graphic (rounded rectangle with CTA text) appears in the image, button color and button text are not applicable.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

5. COMPANY INFORMATION
Company Name: Crunch Fitness
Company Status: Well-Known Private Company

REASONING: The ad clearly shows Crunch branding and the Instagram handle 'crunchgainesville'. Crunch Fitness is a large, well-known U.S. gym chain (franchised/managed at scale) and is not a small startup. Recent reporting indicates Crunch is owned/controlled by private equity (TPG has been an owner) and operates hundreds of locations and millions of members, consistent with a well-known private company rather than a publicly traded firm. (See Reuters and industry summaries for ownership and scale.).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

6. PRODUCT PRICING
Price: Tiered monthly prices visible on the ad: Peak Results $29.99; Peak $24.99; Base $15.99; Base $9.99 (plus tax/fees and an annual fee).

REASONING: The four membership prices are printed in the image header row for each plan column ($29.99, $24.99, $15.99, $9.99). Independent industry and consumer guides for Crunch membership tiers show the same tier names and similar price ranges (Base typically as low as $9.99 with a 12‑month commitment, Base month-to-month higher, Peak around mid-$20s, Peak Results around $29.99). Prices vary by club and by commitment; the ad also displays small-print about a $49.99 annual fee and a $2 processing fee, which aligns with published guidance on Crunch fees. citeturn0search0turn0search4turn0search3

7. COMPANY ORIGIN
Country: United States
State/Region: New York

REASONING: Crunch Fitness is a U.S.-based gym chain. Multiple corporate and news sources list Crunch Fitness as headquartered in New York (the company was founded in New York and operates nationwide). Recent reporting also discusses Crunch's private-equity ownership and U.S. expansion. citeturn0news15turn0news14

8. CALL TO ACTION
Action Type: Visit Website
Description: The ad (and visible Instagram caption) asks users to join online and use the promo 'SQUAT' for $1 to join and free October; the explicit prompt is 'Join online now' with a pointing emoji directing viewers to an online sign-up link (not visible in full in the screenshot). The action required is to visit the gym's website (or the Instagram sign-up link) to enroll and enter the promo code.

REASONING: The Instagram caption at the bottom of the screenshot reads 'SQUAtober starts now! 🎉 $1 to join + ALL October FREE with Code SQUAT. Join online now at 👉' which clearly directs the viewer to go online and sign up. The image itself highlights membership pricing and totals, supporting the website-enrollment CTA. Because the image does not show an app download or video play instruction, the most accurate CTA classification is 'Visit Website' (join online). The promo-code language and $1 enrollment mention make the enrollment action explicit. (Caption visible in the screenshot.)
