Ad Intelligence Challenge

Your Goal:
Create a model or prototype that processes ad creatives (images or videos) and extracts novel, high-value features or insights that could feed into a recommendation engine.

NOTE: We will be using the SnapAR glasses to properly display this data for the user to visualize (possibly with WebXR)
